            <h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it?</h2>
            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the
              visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
            <p>An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar
              service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service Privacy Policy is available here: <a
                href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>. After approval of your
              comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>
            <h3>Media</h3>
            <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF
              GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the
              website.</p>
            <h3>Contact forms</h3>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt in to saving your name, email address and website in
              cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you
              leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
            <p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies.
              This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
            <p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen
              display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you
              select “Remember Me”, your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login
              cookies will be removed.</p>
            <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie
              includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires
              after 1 day.</p>
            <h2>Embedded content from other websites</h2>
            <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded
              content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
            </p>
            <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and
              monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded
              content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
            <h3>Analytics</h3>
            <h2>Who we share your data with?<br>How long we retain your data?</h2>
            <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
              recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.
            </p>
            <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in
              their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they
              cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
            <h2>What rights you have over your data?</h2>
            <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file
              of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
              that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep
              for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
            <h2>Where we send your data?</h2>
            <p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>
            <h2>Your contact information<br>Additional information</h2>
            <p>How we protect your data</p>
            <p>What data breach procedures we have in place</p>
